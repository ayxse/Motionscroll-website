## About MotionScroll (The Android App)

MotionScroll allows you to scroll through your Android screen using simple head movements. It's built with Jetpack Compose and ML Kit.

The application leverages the front camera and Android's accessibility features to enable hands-free scrolling based on head tilt detection.

Key features include:
*   Head-controlled vertical scrolling.
*   System-wide control in most scrollable apps.
*   Multiple scroll modes (Continuous, Skip, Delay).
*   Adjustable skip distance and custom cooldowns.
*   Easy camera toggle.
*   Privacy-focused: Face detection processing happens on-device.
